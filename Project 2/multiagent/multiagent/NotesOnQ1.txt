Average score : 1059

We first compute the Manhattan distance to each ghost and verify if the ghost is active or not. If the ghost is active,
it can kill pacman. We store the the Manhattan distance to each active ghost and the negative of the Manhattan distance
to each inactive ghost in a list. 

We store the negative distance for an inactive ghost as we would like to eat that ghost. It is not necessary to eact the
inactive ghost, but we believe this strategy results in better scores. 

Also if we notice the the manhattan distance to the ghost reaches 1, we run away from the ghost by returning the minimum
integer value as the score for going the ghost's direction. We tried higher values for this and stuck woth 1 as this 
gives best performance. 

We also compute the sum of manhattan distances to all the food left. The sum of the distances to ghosts is divided by
the the sum of manhattan distances to the food. This number is then added to the score returned.
